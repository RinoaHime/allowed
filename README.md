This program allows you to check if a Python program only uses certain constructs.
The check is purely syntactic: the various uses of a construct can't be
individually allowed or disallowed. For example, you can't allow integer addition
and disallow string concatenation (or vice versa): either you allow
the `+` operator (and all its uses) or not.

Like all static analysis tools, `allowed` isn't perfect and will never be.
It will likely let pass some violations of the subset of Python you intend to enforce.

## Usage
Download the files in this repository and type in a terminal or Command Prompt:
```bash
python allowed.py path/to/folder_or_file
```
For example, you can check `allowed` itself and the sample file with:
```bash
python allowed.py allowed.py
python allowed.py sample.py
```
If you want to check all Python files in a folder and its subfolders, type:
```bash
python allowed.py /home/my_project
```
or whatever the path to the folder is.

If a line of code uses several disallowed constructs, it's reported multiple times.
If the Python parser doesn't keep the line number for a disallowed construct,
it's reported first, at 'line zero'.

To check code in a Jupyter notebook, save it as a Python file and check that file.
In the classic web interface, use menu File -> Download as -> Python.

`allowed` assumes that your course or textbook is organised in 'units'
(lessons, weeks, chapters, whatever you want) and that they are cumulative:
a Python construct introduced in a unit can be used in any subsequent unit.

Typing a unit number after the file or folder path will check the file(s)
only against the Python constructs introduced up to that unit (inclusive).
For example, to check your submission to an assessment that covers units 1 to 5,
check it with:
```bash
python allowed.py submission.py 5
```
For example, try
```bash
python allowed.py sample.py 2
python allowed.py sample.py 4
```
to see the difference in the allowed constructs.

The earlier examples, without a unit number, correspond to considering all units,
i.e. checking against _all_ allowed Python constructs.

If the file name starts with the unit number, you can leave the number out, e.g.
```bash
python allowed.py 05_submission.py
```
also allows only constructs introduced in units 1â€“5. However, if the filename
starts with a number that isn't the intended unit, you must provide it:
```bash
python allowed.py 01_submission.py 5
```

## Configuration
The program is already configured for our course,
[M269](https://www.open.ac.uk/courses/modules/m269), but you can change that.

You can define which constructs are introduced in which units by setting
the constant `CONSTRUCTS` in `allowed.py`. See the file for details.

You can also decide whether to allow the `else` clause in for- and while-loops
by setting the Boolean constants `FOR_ELSE` and `WHILE_ELSE` in `allowed.py`.

You can set constant `FILE_UNIT` to the
[regular expression](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html)
that extracts the unit number from the file name. See the file for details.

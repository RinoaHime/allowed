Courses often use a restricted subset of a programming language and its library,
for various reasons: reduce cognitive load, focus on concepts, simplify marking, etc.

This program checks if your Python files and notebooks only use certain constructs,
which you can configure.

Like all static analysis tools, `allowed` isn't perfect and will never be.
There may be false positives (code reported to be a violation, but isn't)
and false negatives (code that uses disallowed constructs but isn't reported).

If you're an M269 student or tutor, read the [quick guide](docs/m269_guide.md);

This program allows you to check if a Python program only uses certain constructs.
The check is purely syntactic and therefore assumes the program compiles.
The various uses of a construct can't be individually allowed or disallowed.
For example, you can't allow integer addition
and disallow string concatenation (or vice versa): either you allow
the `+` operator (and all its uses) or not.

Like all static analysis tools, `allowed` isn't perfect and will never be.
There will be false positives (code reported as a violation, but isn't)
and false negatives (code is a violation but isn't reported).

## Usage
Download the files in this repository and type in a terminal:
```bash
python allowed.py path/to/file.py
```
This will list all disallowed constructs in the file.
If the file has a syntax error, it can't be parsed and hence it's not checked.

For example, you can check the sample file and the `allowed` code with:
```bash
python allowed.py sample.py
python allowed.py allowed.py
```
The latter will list many violations because the program uses many advanced
Python features and modules not allowed by the basic default configuration.

If you want to check all Python files in a folder and its subfolders, type:
```bash
python allowed.py path/to/folder
```

To check code in a Jupyter notebook, save it as a Python file and check that file.
In the classic web interface, use menu File -> Download as -> Python.

`allowed` assumes that your course or textbook is organised in 'units'
(lessons, weeks, chapters, whatever you want) and that they are cumulative:
a Python construct introduced in a unit can be used in any subsequent unit.

Typing a unit number after the file or folder path will check the file(s)
only against the Python constructs introduced up to that unit (inclusive).
For example, checking a submission to an assessment that covers units 1 to 5
can be done with:
```bash
python allowed.py submission.py 5
```
To see the weekly difference in the allowed constructs, type for example:
```bash
python allowed.py sample.py 2
python allowed.py sample.py 4
```
The earlier examples, without a unit number, correspond to considering all units,
i.e. checking against _all_ allowed Python constructs.

If the file name starts with the unit number, you can leave out the number, e.g.
```bash
python allowed.py 05_submission.py
```
also checks against the constructs introduced in units 1â€“5. However, if the filename
starts with a number that isn't the intended unit, you must provide it,
e.g. if the file name starts with the number of the assignment, not of the unit:
```bash
python allowed.py 01_submission.py 5
```

To check if the attribute access `variable.method` is allowed,
the program needs to know the type of `variable`. For that purpose, it uses
the [`pytype`](https://google.github.io/pytype) type checker,
which only works with Python versions 3.7 to 3.10.
If you don't have such a version or have not installed `pytype`,
`allowed` skips those checks (which by the way slow down the process substantially).

## Configuration
The program is already configured for our course,
[M269](https://www.open.ac.uk/courses/modules/m269), but you can change that.

You can define which constructs, modules, built-in functions and methods
are introduced in which units by setting the constants
`CONSTRUCTS`, `IMPORTS`, `FUNCTIONS` and `METHODS` in `allowed.py`.
See the file for details.

You can also decide whether to allow the `else` clause in for- and while-loops
by setting the Boolean constants `FOR_ELSE` and `WHILE_ELSE` in `allowed.py`.

You can set constant `FILE_UNIT` to the
[regular expression](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html)
that extracts the unit number from the file name. See the file for details.
